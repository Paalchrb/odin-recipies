    <h1>Baking Recipes</h1>
    <p>
      After living with a baking enthusiast for almost 10 years I decided to share some 
      of the our favorite recipes. The criteria for the published recipes are a combination 
      of easy baking process and amazing taste. These recipes does not require advanced
      baking skills nor fancy equipment. You will do fine with the ability to 
      read and a bit of patience.
